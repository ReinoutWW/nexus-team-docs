# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the `nexus-team-docs` repository - a team documentation project that is currently in its initial setup phase. The repository is empty and awaiting initial content and technology stack decisions.

## Repository Status

- **Current State**: Empty repository, no content yet
- **Branch**: master
- **Remote**: https://github.com/ReinoutWW/nexus-team-docs.git

## Development Notes

Since this repository is currently empty, the specific development commands and architecture guidance will need to be updated once:

1. A documentation technology stack is chosen (e.g., GitBook, Docusaurus, MkDocs, Sphinx, etc.)
2. Initial project structure is established
3. Build and deployment processes are configured

## Future Updates Needed

When content is added to this repository, this CLAUDE.md file should be updated to include:

- Build commands specific to the chosen documentation framework
- Local development server commands
- Deployment processes
- Documentation structure and conventions
- Any team-specific guidelines for contributing to the documentation

## Initial Setup Considerations

For a team documentation repository, common technology choices include:

- **Static Site Generators**: Docusaurus, GitBook, MkDocs, VuePress, Sphinx
- **Markdown-based**: Most documentation frameworks support Markdown
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or custom hosting
- **CI/CD**: Automated building and deployment on content changes
